# Maxar Coding Exercise

This repository represents my submission for the maxar coding exercise. I started this project by developing a local backend and a local frontend. I assumed that the backend I was developing may not necessarily be deployed to the same location as the single page application I was developing, and wrote code accordingly.

## Deployment

The firebase functions service is deployed [here](https://us-central1-maxarcodingexercise.cloudfunctions.net/app), with the relevant endpoint [here](https://us-central1-maxarcodingexercise.cloudfunctions.net/app/data). The single page application was deployed to firebase hosting, and is available [here](https://maxarcodingexercise.web.app/).
